# IBD

## Isolation by distance (IBD) analysis of population genetic data, based on functions in the package 'adegenet' and associated tutorial. 
This R-markdown document contains R-scripts to select genotypes based on a stratification scheme and conduct various analyses to infer genetic isolation by distance. 

Example data and stratification files are included, and a file of average lat/lon positions for the populations. For the purposes of the tutorial, repetitions for re-sampling tests have been set to 100, but should be increased as indicated in the comments for data analysis. 

The markdown file can be knit to html, but not to Word or pdf. For pdf output, un-comment the pdf()/dev.off() lines in each section.
